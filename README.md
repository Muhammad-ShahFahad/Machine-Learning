This repository documents my machine learning learning journey. It includes detailed notes (Word files) and mini projects covering supervised learning, unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning. Each section contains theory, implementation, and practical examples to strengthen my understanding of core ML concepts.
